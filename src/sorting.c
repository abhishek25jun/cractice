/**
 * Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm.

 * unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the 
 * unsorted part is the entire list.
 * The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with 
 * the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array.
 * This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.
 * This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case 
 * complexities are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
 * complexity: O(n2)
